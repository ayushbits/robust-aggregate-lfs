1	Excessive , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and comic-strip characters .
1	Once the 50 year old Benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back .
3	A working class `` us vs. them '' opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered .
1	If the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of ` there but for the grace of God , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world .
1	There are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part Sliding Doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them .

2	While much of the cast has charm -- especially Allodi and Nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film 's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy .
2	This directorial debut from music video show-off Higuchinsky is all flash .
2	Yes , Ballistic is silly .

1	The film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when Carvey 's Saturday Night Live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment .
2	Jacquot 's rendering of Puccini 's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera .

0	At its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects .
1	From the opening scenes , it 's clear that All About the Benjamins is a totally formulaic movie .
0	It takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as ` worse than expected , ' but Ghost Ship somehow manages to do exactly that .
2	On the bright side , it contains Jesse Ventura 's best work since the XFL .
2	Despite impeccable acting ... and a script that takes some rather unexpected -LRB- even , at times , preposterous -RRB- turns , Love is just too , too precious in the end .
1	A TV style murder mystery with a few big screen moments -LRB- including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether -RRB- .
1	By getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , I found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie .

2	If only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con .
1	I 'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here .
2	Without the dark spookiness of Crystal Lake Camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace .
0	It 's like every bad idea that 's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs ' slickness and sophistication -LRB- and who knew they even had any ? -RRB- .
1	While the Resident Evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these .
1	For close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one .
2	To my taste , the film 's comic characters come perilously close to being Amoses and Andys for a new generation .
1	What the director ca n't do is make either of Val Kilmer 's two personas interesting or worth caring about .
1	In an effort , I suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy .
0	It 's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here 's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role .
2	Harland Williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment .
1	... nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects .
1	It 's not that Kung Pow is n't funny some of the time -- it just is n't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all Oedekerk 's impish augmentation .
0	A very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction .
0	Not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions .
0	A science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left .
1	Once -LRB- Kim -RRB- begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors , you may decide it 's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard .
0	The words , ` Frankly , my dear , I do n't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate .
2	What 's next : `` My Mother the Car ? ''
1	All the amped-up Tony Hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal ca n't disguise the fact that , really , we 've been here , done that .

1	What was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian .
2	A perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments .
1	For all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there 's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love 's dissolution .
1	A coarse and stupid gross-out .
1	a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes .
1	Does n't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces ... that raise the bar on stylized screen violence .
2	There 's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like Lavinia , to go the conservative route .
0	It 's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions .
2	The stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious .
0	But the power of these -LRB- subjects -RRB- is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film 's narrative .
1	Rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment .
1	Tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar .
0	Paid In Full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from Brian De Palma 's Scarface .
1	That 's a cheat .
3	Harrison 's Flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all .
0	This re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against .
1	A string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity .
1	The movie is Dawn of the Dead crossed with John Carpenter 's Ghosts of Mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second .
1	Basically a static series of semi-improvised -LRB- and semi-coherent -RRB- raps between the stars .
1	Too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging ... The Isle defies an easy categorization .
2	An unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer\/director John McKay can swallow .
3	It 's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible .
0	`` The Time Machine '' is a movie that has no interest in itself .
0	It does n't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor ... it 's just plain bored .
1	... a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it .
2	A morose little soap opera about three vapid , insensitive people who take turns hurting each other .

2	columns from Ladies Home Journal ...
2	The film 's essentially over by the meet-cute .
2	I 'm sure if you 're a Hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself ... Me , I did n't care for it .
3	It 's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think .
2	Socrates motions for hemlock .
1	The script is n't very good ; not even someone as gifted as Hoffman -LRB- the actor -RRB- can make it work .
2	Walter Hill 's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama Undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity .
1	It has all the excitement of eating oatmeal .
2	It 's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there 's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong .
2	Although there are several truly jolting scares , there 's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at .
1	I 'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film .
2	Star Trek : Nemesis meekly goes where nearly every Star Trek movie has gone before .
0	Wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by Silly Putty and Kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test Trekkie loyalty .
2	Like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all .
1	I do n't mind having my heartstrings pulled , but do n't treat me like a fool .
1	Its well of thorn and vinegar -LRB- and simple humanity -RRB- has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks .
1	For all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , Lily Chou-Chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam .
0	Do n't be fooled by the impressive cast list - Eye See You is pure junk .
0	Not since Freddy Got Fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through .
2	The documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation .
1	Plays like a volatile and overlong W magazine fashion spread .
1	A better title , for all concerned , might be Swept Under the Rug .
1	This movie seems to have been written using Mad-libs .
2	There can be no other explanation .
3	Hilariously inept and ridiculous .
1	Vera 's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them .
0	-LRB- A -RRB- shapeless blob of desperate entertainment .
1	Feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work .
0	Given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing Soderbergh has ever done .
1	a by-the-numbers patient\/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground
1	A dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going .
1	Stealing Harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time .
2	Pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery .
3	For this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- Chelsea Walls deserves a medal .
0	With the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by Cedric the Entertainer as Perry 's boss , there is n't a redeeming moment here .
1	It 's a grab bag of genres that do n't add up to a whole lot of sense .
1	Movie fans , get ready to take off ... the other direction .
0	-LRB- director -RRB- O'Fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short .
2	The intent is almost exactly the same -LRB- as The Full Monty -RRB- .
1	All that 's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight .
0	No one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through The Master of Disguise .
1	Even the finest chef ca n't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and Robert De Niro ca n't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy .
1	There 's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging .
2	It 's not without its pleasures , but I 'll stick with The Tune .
3	Miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness .
1	Despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine .
2	More maudlin than sharp .
3	This is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director Dario Argento -LRB- a producer here -RRB- , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic .
0	It 's slow -- very , very slow .
1	It 's not the ultimate Depression-era gangster movie .
1	That 's pure PR hype .
1	Characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license Avary employs .
1	Comes ... uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of The Bicycle Thief .
1	Visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide Treasure Planet entirely and completely reimagine it .
0	Stealing Harvard is evidence that the Farrelly Bros. -- Peter and Bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with Green 's half-hearted movie career .
1	There seems to be no clear path as to where the story 's going , or how long it 's going to take to get there .
2	If you 're a WWF fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in A.I. , you 'll probably like Rollerball .
0	I do n't think I laughed out loud once .
0	And when you 're talking about a slapstick comedy , that 's a pretty big problem .
1	It 's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just ca n't get no satisfaction .
0	Slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler 's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $ 40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ?
0	... turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock .
0	The notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy .
0	My reaction in a word : disappointment .
0	His last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it .
2	It kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others .
1	Sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is Rebecca Romijn-Stamos .
3	Intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story 's least interesting subject .
0	Feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot .
1	For each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike Tara Reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout .
1	I 've always dreamed of attending Cannes , but after seeing this film , it 's not that big a deal .
2	The vintage is pure ' 87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : Fatal Attraction = do n't have an affair with a nutjob ; Unfaithful = do n't if you 're married to one .
2	A workshop mentality prevails .
0	It can not be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull .
0	Yes , dull .
2	Pumpkin wants to have it both ways .
1	Director Uwe Boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback .

0	As A Rumor of Angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even Ms. Redgrave 's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality .
2	New Best Friend 's Playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous .
1	The humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant .
2	Scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; Perdition , meanwhile , reads more like Driving Miss Daisy than GoodFellas .
2	While the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target .
1	As the latest bid in the TV-to-movie franchise game , I Spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor .

1	No aspirations to social import inform the movie version .
0	This is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars .

2	This rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that 's about all it does well .

0	A great ensemble cast ca n't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar .
0	There ought to be a directing license , so that Ed Burns can have his revoked .
3	The structure the film takes may find Matt Damon and Ben Affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a Good Will Hunting trilogy that was never planned .
2	Whereas last year 's exemplary Sexy Beast seemed to revitalize the British gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it .

1	The tale of Tok -LRB- Andy Lau -RRB- , a sleek sociopath on the trail of O -LRB- Takashi Sorimachi -RRB- , the most legendary of Asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold .
1	Directed in a paint-by-numbers manner .

3	A fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of Malcolm in the Middle and its pubescent star , Frankie Muniz .
1	Jason X is positively anti-Darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and Jason still kills on auto-pilot .
1	To say this was done better in Wilder 's Some Like It Hot is like saying the sun rises in the east .

1	Another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues .
1	Shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere .
2	I ca n't quite recommend it -- it 's too patched together -- but I almost can ; it 's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it .
1	Complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort
1	Though Perry and Hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn , neither the actors nor director Reginald Hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .

2	I felt sad for Lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by Rohmer , for example .
1	Prurient playthings aside , there 's little to love about this English trifle .
1	This is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs .
1	The film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle .

1	Is the time really ripe for a warmed-over James Bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ?
1	There 's enough melodrama in this Magnolia Primavera to make PTA proud yet director Muccino 's characters are less worthy of Puccini than they are of daytime television .
1	However it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust .
0	The humor is n't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original .
1	But it could have been worse .
1	Some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , Pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny .

1	... Designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , `` Crossroads '' instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns .
1	it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so

2	There 's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in Point Pleasant .
1	In the second half of the film , Frei 's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives Nachtwey for self-analysis .
2	Director Barry Skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of `` The Longest Yard '' playbook like a checklist .
1	The furious coherence that -LRB- DeNiro -RRB- brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing .

0	Just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story .
2	Or a profit .
1	Or some damn thing .
0	The acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from Gilligan 's Island -- and the CGI Scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year .
0	Enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment .
0	The makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep .
3	I like Frank the Pug , though .
2	A restrained Ribisi convinces as an Italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor 's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones .
1	Gee , a second assassin shot Kennedy ?
1	Moot point .
1	A hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face .
0	Needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey .
2	The problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , Mr. Desplechin is content to state it .
0	Madonna still ca n't act a lick .
1	Even the imaginative gore ca n't hide the musty scent of Todd Farmer 's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 Alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship .
1	If you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce .
3	The episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life .
1	But the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .
4	Serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in America in 2002 .
1	But hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .
1	Do n't let your festive spirit go this far .
1	Though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed ... that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like Mr. Schepisi 's seems skimpy and unclear .
2	Hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it 's heading .
1	Intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area .
2	Sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary .
1	Director Brian Levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you 'll find on a French poodle .
1	... perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world .
1	Suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let 's just say the ingredients do n't quite add up to a meal .
1	I 'd give real money to see the perpetrators of Chicago torn apart by dingoes .
2	Movies like this are selling the old European candor , the old wink of ` bold ' revelation .
2	But in 2002 , such revelations wilt .
1	The timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off .
3	A fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy .
1	Flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind .
2	Even if you feel like you 've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to Belushi 's easy-going likableness .
1	The story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence .
3	Despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy .
1	McKay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
0	A recipe for cinematic disaster ... part Quentin Tarantino , part Guy Ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it 's all bad .
2	The cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie 's power as a work of drama .

2	Well before it 's over , Beijing Bicycle begins spinning its wheels .
1	Home Alone goes Hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even Steven Spielberg would know how to do .
2	Besides , real movie producers are n't this nice .
2	-LRB- Nelson 's -RRB- movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised , unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes .

2	In the end , White Oleander is n't an adaptation of a novel .
2	It 's a flashy , star-splashed reduction .
2	This film , starring Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock , is your typical ` fish out of water ' story .

0	There is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .
0	This extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long .
1	Earnest but earthbound ... a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama\/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast .
1	The pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film ca n't help but go soft and stinky .
1	For all its alleged youthful fire , XXX is no less subservient to Bond 's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero .
1	A predictable and stereotypical little B-movie .
1	If I Spy were funny -LRB- enough -RRB- or exciting -LRB- enough -RRB- then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it 's trying to reap from the moviegoing public .

2	For all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that Kapur tries to bring to The Four Feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear .
1	When it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than Pokemon 4Ever .
2	What The Four Feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about .
1	While Benigni -LRB- who stars and co-wrote -RRB- seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that .
2	Yes , 4Ever is harmless in the extreme and it 'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to Spirited Away ?

2	This kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch .
2	But director Danny DeVito and screenwriter Adam Resnick -LRB- remember Cabin Boy ? -RRB-
2	just pound away .
1	At times , however , Dogtown and Z-Boys lapses into an insider 's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about .
3	Rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation .

1	Most of the action setups are incoherent .
1	Liman , of Swingers and Go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase .
1	... surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs .
1	The problem is n't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of Schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .
1	Dreary , highly annoying ... ` Some Body ' will appeal to No One .
2	There 's something deeply creepy about Never Again , a new arrow in Schaeffer 's quiver of ineptitudes .
1	The problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there 's no saving the movie .
1	Sorry , Charlie
1	A painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots .
1	Blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but Ahola is simply not an actor .
1	And in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes Arnold Schwarzenegger look like Spencer Tracy .
0	The cartoon that is n't really good enough to be on afternoon TV is now a movie that is n't really good enough to be in theaters .
1	Shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker 's bottomless pit of self-absorption .
1	This pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film 's producers would be in the clink for life .
1	All ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click .
0	If this is the Danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps .
0	Formula 51 is so trite that even Yu 's high-energy action stylings ca n't break through the stupor .
2	Only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry .
1	When the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you 're in trouble .
1	-LRB- Two -RRB- fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable Scandinavian settlers in 18th-century Canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now .

3	It 's a scorcher .
4	Bittersweet comedy\/drama full of life , hand gestures , and some really adorable Italian guys .
4	Works as pretty contagious fun .
4	The best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism , and Bertrand Tavernier 's oft-brilliant Safe Conduct -LRB- `` Laissez-passer '' -RRB- wears its heart on its sleeve .

2	Sa da TAY !
3	Oddly , the film is n't nearly as downbeat as it sounds , but strikes a tone that 's alternately melancholic , hopeful and strangely funny .
2	I would be shocked if there was actually one correct interpretation , but that should n't make the movie or the discussion any less enjoyable .

4	One of the funnier movies in town .
3	Campanella 's competent direction and his excellent cast overcome the obstacles of a predictable outcome and a screenplay that glosses over Rafael 's evolution .

3	A vivid , spicy footnote to history , and a movie that grips and holds you in rapt attention from start to finish .

3	An energetic and engaging film that never pretends to be something it is n't .
2	A violent initiation rite for the audience , as much as it is for Angelique , the -LRB- opening -RRB- dance guarantees Karmen 's enthronement among the cinema 's memorable women .
4	An animation landmark as monumental as Disney 's 1937 breakthrough Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs .
3	An entertaining , if ultimately minor , thriller .
4	Sex With Strangers is fascinating ...
2	A subtle , poignant picture of goodness that is flawed , compromised and sad .

2	A penetrating glimpse into the tissue-thin ego of the stand-up comic .
4	Kids should have a stirring time at this beautifully drawn movie .

3	Paid in Full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of Goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks .
2	Less cinematically powerful than quietly and deeply moving , which is powerful in itself .
3	waydowntown manages to nail the spirit-crushing ennui of denuded urban living without giving in to it .
4	Each of these stories has the potential for Touched by an Angel simplicity and sappiness , but Thirteen Conversations About One Thing , for all its generosity and optimism , never resorts to easy feel-good sentiments .

1	Often demented in a good way , but it is an uneven film for the most part .

3	It can be safely recommended as a video\/DVD babysitter .
4	Another Best of the Year selection .

4	It 's a very valuable film ...
3	Max pokes , provokes , takes expressionistic license and hits a nerve ... as far as art is concerned , it 's mission accomplished .
4	Literary purists may not be pleased , but as far as mainstream matinee-style entertainment goes , it does a bang-up job of pleasing the crowds .
2	Here Polanski looks back on those places he saw at childhood , and captures them by freeing them from artefact , and by showing them heartbreakingly drably .
4	The story itself it mostly told through on-camera interviews with several survivors , whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it 's as if it all happened only yesterday .
3	A compelling story of musical passion against governmental odds .

3	The best film of the year 2002 .

3	Surprisingly , the film is a hilarious adventure and I shamelessly enjoyed it .
3	The Way Home is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and ... often misconstrued as weakness .
4	Brutally honest and told with humor and poignancy , which makes its message resonate .
3	If you can read the subtitles -LRB- the opera is sung in Italian -RRB- and you like ` Masterpiece Theatre ' type costumes , you 'll enjoy this movie .
4	A pretty funny movie , with most of the humor coming , as before , from the incongruous but chemically perfect teaming of Crystal and De Niro .
4	Gangster No. 1 is solid , satisfying fare for adults .
4	This Chicago has hugely imaginative and successful casting to its great credit , as well as one terrific score and attitude to spare .
1	Has enough gun battles and throwaway humor to cover up the yawning chasm where the plot should be .

3	You will likely prefer to keep on watching .

1	Exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable .
2	-LRB- Garbus -RRB- discards the potential for pathological study , exhuming instead , the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation .

1	Not so much farcical as sour .
1	Unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script .
1	All the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject .
0	A sentimental mess that never rings true .
1	While the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour TV documentary .
2	Interesting , but not compelling .
0	On a cutting room floor somewhere lies ... footage that might have made No Such Thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire .
1	While the ensemble player who gained notice in Guy Ritchie 's Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch has the bod , he 's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle .
1	There is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that do n't care about being stupid
1	Nothing here seems as funny as it did in Analyze This , not even Joe Viterelli as De Niro 's right-hand goombah .

1	On its own , it 's not very interesting .
0	As a remake , it 's a pale imitation .
0	It shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there 's a little girl-on-girl action .
2	A farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it is n't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films .

1	Payami tries to raise some serious issues about Iran 's electoral process , but the result is a film that 's about as subtle as a party political broadcast .

1	Another useless recycling of a brutal mid - '70s American sports movie .
0	Please , someone , stop Eric Schaeffer before he makes another film .
0	Most of the problems with the film do n't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved

2	There 's no getting around the fact that this is Revenge Of The Nerds Revisited -- again .
0	The effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it 's hardly watchable .
2	Analyze That regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film 's successes , with a few new swings thrown in .
1	With flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , Undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout ... by which time it 's impossible to care who wins .
1	Stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom .
0	To the civilized mind , a movie like Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement .
1	Equlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old 's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and Farenheit 451 .
0	The lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced ... It 's a pity that -LRB- Nelson 's -RRB- achievement does n't match his ambition .
2	When Seagal appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit , I wanted to stand up in the theater and shout , ` Hey , Kool-Aid ! '
2	An easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character .

2	Watching Harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but Boyd 's film offers little else of consequence .

1	You 'll feel like you ate a Reeses without the peanut butter ... '
1	Gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance .
2	Parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone ... that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story 's core .
2	The director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn .

1	An inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director 's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength .
0	To build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved .
0	With the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which They is n't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright .
2	Mild , meandering teen flick .
2	Though its atmosphere is intriguing ... the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression .

2	Indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is Deuces Wild .
2	One thing is for sure : This movie does not tell you a whole lot about Lily Chou-Chou .
1	With a tone as variable as the cinematography , Schaeffer 's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters ' quirks and foibles never jell into charm .

1	While it is interesting to witness the conflict from the Palestinian side , Longley 's film lacks balance ... and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context .

1	It 's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from `` promising '' to `` interesting '' to `` familiar '' before landing squarely on `` stupid '' .

0	-LRB- Carvey 's -RRB- characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark .
1	It 's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar American style of justice that plays out here , but it 's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through .
1	This dreadfully earnest inversion of the Concubine love triangle eschews the previous film 's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension .
2	Brown 's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie .

0	Oedekerk mugs mercilessly , and the genuinely funny jokes are few and far between .
1	Since Dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche .
2	Only those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate .
2	Cold and scattered , Minority Report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals .
2	That 's not vintage Spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying .

1	Viewers are asked so often to suspend belief that were it not for Holm 's performance , the film would be a total washout .
2	It 's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it 's well worth a rental .

3	` Yes , that 's right : it 's Forrest Gump , Angel Of Death . '
3	A wildly erratic drama with sequences that make you wince in embarrassment and others , thanks to the actors , that are quite touching .

0	About as enjoyable , I would imagine , as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces ... positively dreadful .
1	A generic international version of a typical American horror film .
1	... while certainly clever in spots , this too-long , spoofy update of Shakespeare 's Macbeth does n't sustain a high enough level of invention .
1	Lucas has in fact come closer than anyone could desire to the cheap , graceless , hackneyed sci-fi serials of the '30s and '40s .

0	Absurdities and clichÃ©s accumulate like lint in a fat man 's navel .
3	If you think it 's a riot to see Rob Schneider in a young woman 's clothes , then you 'll enjoy The Hot Chick .

3	Strangely comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild .
2	The next big thing 's not-so-big -LRB- and not-so-hot -RRB- directorial debut .
1	Yet another iteration of what 's become one of the movies ' creepiest conventions , in which the developmentally disabled are portrayed with almost supernatural powers to humble , teach and ultimately redeem their mentally `` superior '' friends , family ...
2	Bond-inspired ?
2	Certainly .
3	Likely to have decades of life as a classic movie franchise ?
2	Let 's hope not .
0	This flat run at a hip-hop Tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of Pootie Tang in between its punchlines .
2	Davis has energy , but she does n't bother to make her heroine 's book sound convincing , the gender-war ideas original , or the comic scenes fly .
1	Surprisingly , considering that Baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy .
0	None of this is very original , and it is n't particularly funny .
0	... a bland murder-on-campus yawner .
0	A humorless journey into a philosophical void .
2	These two are generating about as much chemistry as an Iraqi factory poised to receive a UN inspector .
1	Just as the lousy Tarantino imitations have subsided , here comes the first lousy Guy Ritchie imitation .
2	A passable romantic comedy , in need of another couple of passes through the word processor .
1	The movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster\/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches is n't exactly endearing .
1	shows Holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , -LRB- but -RRB- the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that 's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives .
1	Ultimately ... the movie is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults .
2	It 's just a little too self-satisfied .
2	Clever but not especially compelling .
0	McKay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service .
1	A piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : unembarrassing but unmemorable .
2	LaBute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public .
1	The movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne .
0	The problem with ANTWONE FISHER is that it has a screenplay written by Antwone Fisher based on the book by Antwone Fisher .
3	Alarms for Duvall 's throbbing sincerity and his elderly propensity for patting people while he talks .
1	What little grace -LRB- Rifkin 's -RRB- tale of precarious skid-row dignity achieves is pushed into the margins by predictable plotting and tiresome histrionics .
0	Tries to work in the same vein as the brilliance of Animal House but instead comes closer to the failure of the third Revenge of the Nerds sequel .
0	Unfortunately , Kapur modernizes A.E.W. Mason 's story to suit the sensibilities of a young American , a decision that plucks `` The Four Feathers '' bare .
0	... what a banal bore the preachy Circuit turns out to be

2	The respective charms of Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant have worn threadbare .
0	` This movie sucks . '
1	None of this so-called satire has any sting to it , as if Woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him .
3	A few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics are n't likely to enter the theater .
2	Bad in such a bizarre way that it 's almost worth seeing , if only to witness the crazy confluence of purpose and taste .
1	There 's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie .
3	Hugh Grant 's act is so consuming that sometimes it 's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are .
0	Although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film 's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks .
1	I 've had more interesting -- and , dare I say , thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama .
2	What we get ... is Caddyshack crossed with the Loyal Order of Raccoons .
0	The jokes are flat , and the action looks fake .
1	When a movie asks you to feel sorry for Mick Jagger 's sex life , it already has one strike against it .
0	There are now two signs that M. Night Shyamalan 's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : Unbreakable and Signs .
1	... hokey art house pretension .
0	... a weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off .
1	Gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it 's not clear whether we 're supposed to shriek or laugh .
0	Plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo .
0	This is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life .
1	A baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside Danish cows falls flat , and if you 're going to alter the Bard 's ending , you 'd better have a good alternative .
2	Soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable .
0	The only thing that distinguishes a Randall Wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a Randall Wallace film .
1	Silly stuff , all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who ca n't quite distinguish one sci-fi work from another .
2	There is so much plodding sensitivity .
1	The town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial .
1	... too sappy for its own good .
2	Circuit queens wo n't learn a thing , they 'll be too busy cursing the film 's strategically placed white sheets .
4	As an actress , Madonna is one helluva singer .
1	As the Mediterranean sparkles , ` Swept Away ' sinks .
1	Every so often a film comes along that is so insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways that watching it leaves you giddy .
4	Half Past Dead is just such an achievement .
2	Expanded to 65 minutes for theatrical release , it still feels somewhat unfinished .
1	It all looks and plays like a $ 40 million version of a game you 're more likely to enjoy on a computer .
2	-LRB- Javier Bardem is -RRB- one of the few reasons to watch the film , which director Gerardo Vera has drenched in swoony music and fever-pitched melodrama .
1	Feels shrill , simple and soapy .
1	Adults , other than the parents ... will be hard pressed to succumb to the call of the wild .
2	Brady achieves the remarkable feat of squandering a topnotch foursome of actors ... by shoving them into every clichÃ©d white-trash situation imaginable .
1	In the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick , The Emperor 's Club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach .
1	No amount of blood and disintegrating vampire cadavers can obscure this movie 's lack of ideas .
2	A direct-to-void release , heading nowhere .
1	Typical animÃ© , with cheapo animation -LRB- like Saturday morning TV in the '60s -RRB- , a complex sword-and-sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and Japanese names .
0	Below is well below expectations .
2	At no point during K-19 : The Widowmaker did this viewer feel enveloped in a story that , though meant to be universal in its themes of loyalty , courage and dedication to a common goal , never seems to leave the lot .

1	Empire ca n't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film .
0	It does n't work as either .
0	Given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have been made for the tube .
2	Possession is in the end an honorable , interesting failure .
3	It falls far short of poetry , but it 's not bad prose .
3	Jonathan Parker 's Bartleby should have been the be-all-end-all of the modern-office anomie films .
1	There may have been a good film in `` Trouble Every Day , '' but it is not what is on the screen .
1	Unfortunately , Carvey 's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with Harris Goldberg .
2	Viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there 's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture .
1	There 's something unintentionally comic in the film 's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties .
2	The Master of Disguise is funny -- not `` ha ha '' funny , `` dead circus performer '' funny .
1	And for all the wrong reasons besides .
1	A zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects , hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and -- worst of all -- silly-looking Morlocks .
0	A 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor .

0	The waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter .
1	With McConaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and Bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids , there 's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd .
2	It 's the type of stunt the Academy loves : a powerful political message stuffed into an otherwise mediocre film .
1	In theory , a middle-aged romance pairing Clayburgh and Tambor sounds promising , but in practice it 's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life .
1	So mind-numbingly awful that you hope Britney wo n't do it one more time , as far as movies are concerned .
2	The images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where Whitaker 's misfit artist is concerned .
1	If Welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two , he probably would n't be too crazy with his great-grandson 's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way .
0	Sets animation back 30 years , musicals back 40 years and Judaism back at least 50 .
1	Weirdly , Broomfield has compelling new material but he does n't unveil it until the end , after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car .
2	Might best be enjoyed as a daytime soaper .
3	eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation .
3	A showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor Michel Serrault , the film is less successful on other levels .
2	Boy oh boy , it 's a howler .

0	The thing just never gets off the ground .
1	... contains very few laughs and even less surprises .
1	The actors must indeed be good to recite some of this laughable dialogue with a straight face .
0	Most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots .
2	The movie is n't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave .
2	However stale the material , Lawrence 's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny .
1	There 's nothing remotely topical or sexy here .
1	The Tuxedo was n't just bad ; it was , as my friend David Cross would call it , ` Hungry-Man portions of bad ' .
1	Blue Crush is so prolonged and boring it is n't even close to being the barn-burningly bad movie it promised it would be .
1	The sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give Blade fans another look at Wesley Snipes ' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once .
2	While Van Wilder may not be the worst National Lampoon film , it 's far from being this generation 's Animal House .
0	So devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it can not even be dubbed hedonistic .
2	Reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish .
2	An exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter .
4	Woody Allen has really found his groove these days .
0	The problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another .
2	The bland outweighs the nifty , and Cletis Tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is .
1	It 's such a mechanical endeavor -LRB- that -RRB- it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it .
4	The art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual DVD release will offer subtitles and the original Italian-language soundtrack .
1	If the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish .
1	Ultimately , in the history of the Academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about `` Chicago '' in 2002 .
1	Zellweger 's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a
1	A seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writer-director Kurt Wimmer at the screenplay level .
1	A pleasant and engaging enough sit , but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole .
1	Its plot and animation offer daytime TV serviceability , but little more .
1	A tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre .
1	Human Nature , in short , is n't nearly as funny as it thinks it is ; neither is it as smart .
3	A film with a great premise but only a great premise .

0	No , I hate it .
3	No , I love it ... hell , I dunno .

0	A fifty car pileup of cliches .
0	It 's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish .
0	Not only is entry number twenty the worst of the Brosnan bunch , it 's one of the worst of the entire franchise .
0	What ultimately makes Windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story .
3	As an actor 's showcase , Hart 's War has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed Willis is not the most impressive player .
1	As a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by Billy Ray and Terry George leaves something to be desired .
1	A non-Britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine .
2	It 's not hateful .
0	It 's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical .
2	Possibly not since Grumpy Old Men have I heard a film so solidly connect with one demographic while striking out with another .
0	The drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin could n't keep my attention .
1	A rather tired exercise in nostalgia .
0	The misery of these people becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle , to be consumed and forgotten .

1	And second , what 's with all the shooting ?
0	Do n't even bother to rent this on video .

0	Not counting a few gross-out comedies I 've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes .
1	Plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of John Waters and Todd Solondz , rather than a fully developed story .
0	The film does n't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made Spy Kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences .

1	They 're the unnamed , easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid .
2	They exist for hushed lines like `` They 're back ! ''
3	, `` They 're out there ! ''
2	and `` They 're coming ! ''
1	Elegantly crafted but emotionally cold , a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level .
1	Were Dylan Thomas alive to witness first-time director Ethan Hawke 's strained Chelsea Walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , ` Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Theatre . '
1	The story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive .
1	I 'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , I do n't see the point .
0	It 's a visual Rorschach test and I must have failed .
1	The film is really closer to porn than a serious critique of what 's wrong with this increasingly pervasive aspect of gay culture .
1	Murder by Numbers just does n't add up .
1	Clare Peploe 's airless movie adaptation could use a little American Pie-like irreverence .
1	Video games are more involving than this mess .
2	Clayburgh and Tambor are charming performers ; neither of them deserves Eric Schaeffer .
1	A pale Xerox of other , better crime movies .
0	... a hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional .
1	Illiterate , often inert sci-fi action thriller .
1	A perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making .
1	The adventure does n't contain half the excitement of Balto , or quarter the fun of Toy Story 2 .
3	Essentially a collection of bits -- and they 're all naughty .
1	A mess .
1	The screenplay does too much meandering , Norton has to recite bland police procedural details , Fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , Hopkins looks like a drag queen .
1	The screenplay by James Eric , James Horton and director Peter O'Fallon ... is so pat it makes your teeth hurt .
3	Before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy , Steven Shainberg 's adaptation of Mary Gaitskill 's harrowing short story ... is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience .
4	Solaris is rigid and evasive in ways that Soderbergh 's best films , `` Erin Brockovich , '' `` Out of Sight '' and `` Ocean 's Eleven , '' never were .
1	Seems like something American and European gay movies were doing 20 years ago .
1	In the process of trimming the movie to an expeditious 84 minutes , director Roger Kumble seems to have dumped a whole lot of plot in favor of ... outrageous gags .
2	You can see the would-be surprises coming a mile away , and the execution of these twists is delivered with a hammer .
0	Thumbs down .
0	The characters are paper thin and the plot is so cliched and contrived that it makes your least favorite James Bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as The Usual Suspects .
1	... del Toro maintains a dark mood that makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy .
1	The movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure .
2	The real question this movie poses is not ` Who ? '
2	but ` Why ? '
3	Now here 's a sadistic bike flick that would have made Vittorio De Sica proud .
1	A movie that 's about as overbearing and over-the-top as the family it depicts .
3	A movie in which laughter and self-exploitation merge into jolly soft-porn 'em powerment . '
2	Occasionally interesting but essentially unpersuasive , a footnote to a still evolving story .
0	If we 're to slap protagonist Genevieve LePlouff because she 's French , do we have that same option to slap her creators because they 're clueless and inept ?
2	Moretti plays Giovanni , a psychiatrist who predictably finds it difficult to sustain interest in his profession after the family tragedy .
1	Too predictably , in fact .
1	Alternative medicine obviously has its merits ... but Ayurveda does the field no favors .
0	This thing works on no level whatsoever for me .
2	It follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every Schwarzenegger film : Someone crosses Arnie .
2	Arnie blows things up .
2	Ice Age posits a heretofore unfathomable question : Is it possible for computer-generated characters to go through the motions ?
0	An incoherent jumble of a film that 's rarely as entertaining as it could have been .
2	... they missed the boat .
1	More dutiful than enchanting ... terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat .
1	Laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it 's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters .
1	The comedy Death to Smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience .
1	Barney 's ideas about creation and identity do n't really seem all that profound , at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour 's worth of actual material .
2	Affleck merely creates an outline for a role he still needs to grow into , a role that Ford effortlessly filled with authority .
1	Cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing Avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude .
2	It makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy 's idea of a good time .
2	The narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys .
1	Nothing more or less than an outright bodice-ripper -- it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows .
3	A living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange .
1	The fact that it is n't very good is almost beside the point .
1	Feels less like a cousin to Blade Runner than like a bottom-feeder sequel in the Escape From New York series .
0	What might have been acceptable on the printed page of Iles ' book does not translate well to the screen .
1	If Oscar had a category called Best Bad Film You Thought Was Going To Be Really Awful But Was n't , Guys would probably be duking it out with The Queen of the Damned for the honor .
0	A poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise .
1	Mediocre fable from Burkina Faso .
3	Fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent .
2	Since the movie is based on a Nicholas Sparks best seller , you know death is lurking around the corner , just waiting to spoil things .
1	Bottom-rung New Jack City wannabe .
1	Fincher takes no apparent joy in making movies , and he gives none to the audience .
1	It 's mildly amusing , but I certainly ca n't recommend it .
3	Nicholas Nickleby celebrates the human spirit with such unrelenting Dickensian decency that it turned me -LRB- horrors ! -RRB-
2	into Scrooge .
1	Fear Dot Com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds .
1	Full of flatulence jokes and mild sexual references , Kung Pow !
1	is the kind of movie that 's critic-proof , simply because it aims so low .
0	May cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists .
1	There are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations .
0	Where 's the movie here ?
2	A dark , dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires .
1	Lacking substance and soul , Crossroads comes up shorter than Britney 's cutoffs .
1	Cassavetes thinks he 's making Dog Day Afternoon with a cause , but all he 's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon .
0	Buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichÃ©s and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled Mr. Chips off the Old Block .
1	Although sensitive to a fault , it 's often overwritten , with a surfeit of weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken .
0	It 's so badly made on every level that I 'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it .
1	In the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a rÃ©sumÃ© loaded with credits like `` Girl in Bar # 3 . ''
1	... although this idea is `` new '' the results are tired .
3	I 'm guessing the director is a magician .
1	After all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long .
1	An unencouraging threefold expansion on the former MTV series , accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc. .
0	In its own way , Joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a Luis BuÃ±uel film without the latter 's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius .
0	an appalling ` Ace Ventura ' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together Kevin Pollak , former wrestler Chyna and Dolly Parton .
1	If any of them list this ` credit ' on their resumes in the future , that 'll be much funnier than anything in the film ...
0	The only entertainment you 'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles -- several of them .
1	Puportedly `` Based on True Events , '' a convolution of language that suggests it 's impossible to claim that it is `` Based on a True Story '' with a straight face .
0	... a plotline that 's as lumpy as two-day old porridge ... the filmmakers ' paws , sad to say , were all over this `` un-bear-able '' project !
3	Tambor and Clayburgh make an appealing couple -- he 's understated and sardonic , she 's appealingly manic and energetic .
1	Both deserve better .
1	-- that the ` true story ' by which All the Queen 's Men is allegedly `` inspired '' was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what 's been cobbled together onscreen .
0	Is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ?
1	I do n't think so .
1	Nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me .
1	Not a stereotype is omitted nor a clichÃ© left unsaid .
0	Another week , another gross-out college comedy -- ugh .
1	A battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee .
0	The movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical .
1	What 's worse is that Pelosi knows it .
1	... instead go rent `` Shakes The Clown '' , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great Robin Williams performance .
1	If the title is a Jeopardy question , then the answer might be `` How does Steven Seagal come across these days ? ''
0	or maybe `` How will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of The Rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ? ''
0	The appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet .
1	The story really has no place to go since Simone is not real -- she ca n't provide any conflict .
1	First-time director JoÃ£o Pedro Rodrigues ' unwillingness to define his hero 's background or motivations becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on .

1	Too bad .
0	Thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad Scouse accents
1	Plays like one of those conversations that Comic Book Guy on `` The Simpsons '' has .
2	`` Juwanna Mann ? ''
1	No thanks .
1	Wewannour money back , actually .
2	Newcomer helmer Kevin Donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept -- a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman .
0	Should n't have been allowed to use the word `` new '' in its title , because there 's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie .
1	Often silly -- and gross -- but it 's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films .
1	The advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap .
1	Any rock pile will do for a set .
0	Reign of Fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap .
2	Britney 's performance can not be faulted .
1	Lucy 's a dull girl , that 's all .
1	I admire it and yet can not recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time .
0	It 's a bad sign when you 're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it 's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .
1	Stephen Earnhart 's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition -- wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text -- when it 's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type .
0	A semi-autobiographical film that 's so sloppily written and cast that you can not believe anyone more central to the creation of Bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it .
0	The movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable naÃ¯vetÃ© and arbitrary flashbacks .
2	Pumpkin struts about with `` courage '' pinned to its huckster lapel while a yellow streak a mile wide decorates its back .
0	Build some robots , haul 'em to the theatre with you for the late show , and put on your own Mystery Science Theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst -- and only -- killer website movie of this or any other year .
0	... has about 3\/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor -- but it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity .
1	It 's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by Scott Kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 Brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo .
1	Gooding and Coburn are both Oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through Snow Dogs , seems inconceivable .
1	At every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability ... all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while Banderas looks like he 's not trying to laugh at how bad it
0	... pitiful , slapdash disaster .
0	A DOA dud from frame one .
1	Jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as John Ritter 's glory days on Three 's Company .
3	There are plenty of scenes in Frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself .
1	Although God Is Great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage , it 's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film .
2	The dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film .
1	First-timer John McKay is never able to pull it back on course .
0	Distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register .
1	Godard uses his characters -- if that 's not too glorified a term -- as art things , mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks .
1	The movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing .
0	A predictable , manipulative stinker .
1	The story passes time until it 's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge .
2	Eastwood winces , clutches his chest and gasps for breath .
3	It 's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it 's only acting .
0	The movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that 's shapeless and uninflected .
1	It 's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where Human Nature should be ingratiating , it 's just grating .
3	An ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic teen .
0	once she lets her love depraved leads meet , -LRB- Denis ' -RRB- story becomes a hopeless , unsatisfying muddle
2	The dose is strong and funny , for the first 15 minutes anyway ; after that , the potency wanes dramatically .
2	The people in ABC Africa are treated as docile , mostly wordless ethnographic extras .
1	What 's really sad is to see two Academy Award winning actresses -LRB- and one Academy Award winning actor -RRB- succumb to appearing in this junk that 's TV sitcom material at best .
3	No doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place .
1	Where their heads were is anyone 's guess .
1	Call me a cynic , but there 's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life-affirming message .
0	A gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups .
3	Got some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights and little room for engaging , imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2Â 1\/2 - hour , dissipated length .
1	A painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than Clyde Barrow 's car .
1	Like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions .
0	I guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen .
0	Gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing .
1	Feels less like a change in -LRB- Herzog 's -RRB- personal policy than a half-hearted fluke .
0	One of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced .
1	Will anyone who is n't a Fangoria subscriber be excited that it has n't gone straight to video ?
1	A selection of scenes in search of a movie .
1	-LRB- Janey -RRB- forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies .
1	Will undoubtedly play well in European markets , where Mr. Besson is a brand name , and in Asia , where Ms. Shu is an institution , but American audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic .
0	True to its animatronic roots : ... as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus ... ` The Country Bears ' should never have been brought out of hibernation .
1	-LRB- Evans is -RRB- a fascinating character , and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie .
0	The script 's judgment and sense of weight is way , way off .
2	You come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that 's at the center of the story .
0	Evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter 's invention .
0	A derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches .
0	Loosely speaking , we 're in All of Me territory again , and , strictly speaking , Schneider is no Steve Martin .
0	As aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four .
1	Limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very , very slowly .
1	Just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name .
1	The redeeming feature of Chan 's films has always been the action , but the stunts in The Tuxedo seem tired and , what 's worse , routine .
1	While The Importance of Being Earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it does n't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond Wilde 's wit and the actors ' performances .
0	Has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool .
1	A rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel .
2	A Lifetime movie about men .
2	The Balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman .
1	It 's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there Tolstoy groupies out there ?
2	It 's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death
1	This is a movie that starts out like Heathers , then becomes Bring it On , then becomes unwatchable .
1	The screenplay flounders under the weight of too many story lines .
1	I think it was Plato who said , ' I think , therefore I know better than to rush to the theatre for this one . '
1	If Damon and Affleck attempt another Project Greenlight , next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about .
1	This is rote drivel aimed at Mom and Dad 's wallet .
0	Contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden ... if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad .
0	I hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of High Art .
2	This is more a case of ` Sacre bleu ! '
2	than ` Magnifique ' .
1	The kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books .
0	Whether Jason X is this bad on purpose is never clear .
0	But one thing 's for sure : It never comes close to being either funny or scary .
2	Yet another weepy Southern bore-athon .
3	I like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they 're treading water at best in this forgettable effort .
2	Perhaps the most annoying thing about Who Is Cletis Tout ?
0	is that it 's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime .
2	Except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made .
1	This insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering .
0	Instead , it 'll only put you to sleep .
2	Who is this movie for ?
2	Not kids , who do n't need the lesson in repugnance .
0	It 's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are ` edgy . '
0	A sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices .
1	It 's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in Bridget Jones 's Diary .
1	Almost as offensive as `` Freddy Got Fingered . ''
1	The gifted Crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him .

1	Ponderous , plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film .
1	Cold , pretentious , thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy .
0	For the future , one hopes Mr. Plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter .
0	A cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at Revolution Studios and Imagine Entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $ 9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life .
1	Reign of Fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness .
3	Human Nature is a goofball movie , in the way that Malkovich was , but it tries too hard .
1	Originality is sorely lacking .
2	The plot 's clearly mythic structure may owe more to Disney 's strong sense of formula than to the original story .
4	But while the highly predictable narrative falls short , Treasure Planet is truly gorgeous to behold .
1	Though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie 's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker 's flailing reputation .
2	Ram Dass Fierce Grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians , of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour .
2	Lucky Break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless , but it 's also drab and inert .
0	For a story set at sea , Ghost Ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed ` surprises . '
1	There might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ?
1	Nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing .
0	I like my Christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho 's .
1	It all seemed wasted like DeNiro 's once promising career and the once grand Long Beach boardwalk .
1	-LRB- I -RRB- t 's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but Barbershop is n't as funny as it should be .
1	Unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various New York City locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style .
2	Just entertaining enough not to hate , too mediocre to love .
2	` Sophisticated ' viewers who refuse to admit that they do n't like it will likely call it ` challenging ' to their fellow sophisticates .
0	Equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid .
1	Excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic .
1	The film 's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes ... drag the movie down .
1	It does n't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject .
0	This kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that I even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater
1	Though Impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture , it too is a bomb .
0	Cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of Nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge .
1	Every note rings false .
1	When the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you 'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence .
1	It never rises to its clever what-if concept .
2	Admirably ambitious but self-indulgent .
1	This story of unrequited love does n't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour .
1	This angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in Ordinary People .
0	The entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another .
1	About half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal .
1	A big , loud , bang-the-drum bore .
0	-LRB- Less a movie than -RRB- an appalling , odoriferous thing ... so rotten in almost every single facet of production that you 'll want to crawl up your own \*\*\* in embarrassment .
3	The concept behind Kung Pow : Enter the Fist is hilarious .
2	It 's too bad nothing else is .
2	Hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast .
1	El Crimen Del Padre Amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-Catholic protestors .
3	Interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of Carmen
4	A serious movie with serious ideas .
1	But seriously , folks , it does n't work .
1	There 's nothing exactly wrong here , but there 's not nearly enough that 's right .
1	The action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises .
1	I could n't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy .
1	What Madonna does here ca n't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it 's moving and it 's talking and it 's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once .

0	Even if you 're an Elvis person , you wo n't find anything to get excited about on this DVD .

1	I 'm sure there 's a teenage boy out there somewhere who 's dying for this kind of entertainment .
0	The Tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life .
1	The film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama .
1	Obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time -LRB- including mine -RRB- on something very inconsequential .
1	There 's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do Joan and Philip 's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery .
1	It drowns in sap .
3	Deliberately and devotedly constructed , Far from Heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate .
1	It 's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that 's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that 's just too boring and obvious .
1	I 'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment .
1	There 's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease .
2	The good thing -- the only good thing -- about Extreme Ops is that it 's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my Thanksgiving to-do list .
1	The modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones .
4	Blessed with a searing lead performance by Ryan Gosling -LRB- Murder by Numbers -RRB- , the movie is powerful and provocative .
1	It 's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness .
1	Uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth .
1	Director Jay Russell stomps in hobnail boots over Natalie Babbitt 's gentle , endearing 1975 children 's novel .
2	Benigni 's Pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow .
1	The troubling thing about Clockstoppers is that it does n't make any sense .
1	With its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it 's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clichÃ©s .
2	Mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting Men in Black mayhem to one part family values .
1	Kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper .
1	A rote exercise in both animation and storytelling .
1	The material and the production itself are little more than routine .
1	The movie 's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it 's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had .
0	Not even Steven Spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie .

1	Schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that 's enough to sustain laughs ...
1	Its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this is n't something to be taken seriously , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare .
1	By the final whistle you 're convinced that this Mean Machine was a decent TV outing that just does n't have big screen magic .
0	To say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor .
0	A film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun .

1	Sweet gentle Jesus , did the screenwriters just do a cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history ?
2	It 's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly wo n't win any honors .
1	This is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm .
0	A loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the TV series .
0	Even on its own ludicrous terms , The Sum of All Fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the Ryan series .
2	Though it inspires some -LRB- out-of-field -RRB- creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract .
0	As predictable as the outcome of a Globetrotters-Generals game , Juwanna Mann is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved .
2	Sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes , masturbation jokes , and racist Japanese jokes .
1	Where Tom Green stages his gags as assaults on America 's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , Jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval .
2	More of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller .
1	The April 2002 instalment of the American War for Independence , complete with loads of CGI and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood .
1	Contains all the substance of a Twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing .

2	On a certain base level , Blue Crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it .
1	The colorful Masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of Ganesh 's rise up the social ladder .
0	... an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar .
1	Wimps out by going for that PG-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted .
3	Trapped presents a frightening and compelling ` What if ? '
2	scenario that will give most parents pause ... Then , something terrible happens .
0	Madonna has made herself over so often now , there 's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like Michael Jackson 's nose .
0	Never having seen the first two films in the series , I ca n't compare Friday After Next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days .
0	The story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched .
0	A depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery .
0	It 's a bad action movie because there 's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring .
1	-LRB- Soderbergh -RRB- tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience 's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness .
2	Handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism .
1	So aggressively cheery that Pollyana would reach for a barf bag .
1	Scooby-Doo does n't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , Nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick .
1	Russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of Sommers 's title-bout features .
0	Highly uneven and inconsistent ... Margarita Happy Hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within .
0	Very stupid and annoying .

1	Every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable .

2	Apparently writer-director Attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film .
2	After the setup , the air leaks out of the movie , flattening its momentum with about an hour to go .
1	This is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like Them !
1	At three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue .
2	A bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be .
2	A crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright Craig Lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his Prelude to a Kiss .
2	The film 's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments .
1	If you recognize Zeus -LRB- the dog from Snatch -RRB- it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one .

2	Shanghai Ghetto should be applauded for finding a new angle on a tireless story , but you might want to think twice before booking passage .
2	Plays like a checklist of everything Rob Reiner and his cast were sending up .
0	There 's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man 's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present .
3	It 's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness .
1	All the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness .
1	A cross between Blow and Boyz N The Hood , this movie strives to be more , but does n't quite get there .
3	Good performances keep it from being a total rehash .
1	The screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children .
2	Troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal .

0	It 's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in Slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny .
1	Despite its promising cast of characters , Big Trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that ` zany ' does n't necessarily mean ` funny . '

1	Just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting .
2	There are a few modest laughs , but certainly no thrills .
1	Fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur .
1	There 's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film 's simple title .
2	While Howard 's appreciation of Brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast .
0	A preposterous , prurient whodunit .
1	Go , girls , right down the reality drain .
1	Boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , Impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie .
1	Can be classified as one of those ` alternate reality ' movies ... except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality .
3	Predictable and cloying , though Brown Sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle .
0	... unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept .

1	Why would anyone cast the magnificent Jackie Chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ?
1	A grating , emaciated flick .
1	Unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook .
2	Presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency .
1	We have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat .
3	According to the script , Grant and Bullock 's characters are made for each other .
2	But you 'd never guess that from the performances .
2	The animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from Bambi and The Lion King , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies .
1	Ararat feels like a book report
1	Steve Oedekerk is , alas , no Woody Allen .
1	A lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless .

1	Shows that Jackie Chan is getting older , and that 's something I would rather live in denial about
2	With miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , Killing Me Softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it 's - good camp .
2	Alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick .

1	This is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks .
1	The problem with the mayhem in Formula 51 is not that it 's offensive , but that it 's boring .

1	the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale
2	Mark Wahlberg ... may look classy in a '60s - homage pokepie hat , but as a character he 's dry , dry , dry .
1	Told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject .
3	The irony is that this film 's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own .
2	Now I can see why people thought I was too hard on `` The Mothman Prophecies '' .
4	If ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it .
0	If ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it .
3	With an unusual protagonist -LRB- a kilt-wearing Jackson -RRB- and subject matter , the improbable `` Formula 51 '' is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger .
2	Sandra Bullock 's best dramatic performance to date -LRB- is -RRB- almost enough to lift -LRB- this -RRB- thrill-kill cat-and-mouser ... above its paint-by-numbers plot .
1	A feel-good movie that does n't give you enough to feel good about .
3	Adolescents will be adequately served by the movie 's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a ` topless tutorial service . '

1	Just consider what New Best Friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay .
1	Oscar caliber cast does n't live up to material
2	The problems of the people in Love in the Time of Money are hardly specific to their era .

1	Carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , Chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , ` If I stay positive , maybe I can channel one of my greatest pictures , Drunken Master . '
0	So putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film .
0	In the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about Kennedy 's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate .
1	Starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichÃ©s .

0	In other words , about as bad a film you 're likely to see all year .
1	Five screenwriters are credited with the clichÃ©-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before .
1	The whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of Bewitched that takes place during Spring Break .
1	Well made but uninvolving , Bloodwork is n't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery .
1	So we got Ten Little Indians meets Friday the 13th by way of Clean and Sober , filmed on the set of Carpenter 's The Thing and loaded with actors you 're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of The Love Boat .
1	The movie 's blatant derivativeness is one reason it 's so lackluster .
1	Kids do n't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there 's lots of cute animals and clumsy people .
2	` Snow Dogs ' has both .
2	It 's almost as if it 's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film .
2	Wobbly Senegalese updating of `` Carmen '' which is best for the stunning star turn by Djeinaba Diop Gai

1	Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson have a cute partnership in I Spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm does n't do a load of good .
1	Strictly a ` guy 's film ' in the worst sense of the expression .
1	There 's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes .
1	It 's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as Phoenix 's .
1	There 's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids ' movie ... that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where Santa gives gifts to grownups .

0	Like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories .

2	Deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits .
1	... comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental .
1	Brosnan 's finest non-Bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film 's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes .
3	A film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , Waiting for Happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact .
1	To me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy .
2	Tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often .

1	-LRB- Denis ' -RRB- bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product .
1	Wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from Lynch , Jeunet , and von Trier while failing to find a spark of its own .
2	Viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some Freudian puppet .
1	Overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste .

1	Writer-director Walter Hill and co-writer David Giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags .
0	There 's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : Mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces .
1	A cockeyed shot all the way .
1	Lush and beautifully photographed -LRB- somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book -RRB- , but ultimately you 'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered .

2	Impostor does n't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast .

0	One sloughs one 's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot .
1	A film which presses familiar Herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised .
2	It 's a fanboy ` what if ? '
3	brought to life on the big screen .
1	The story itself is actually quite vapid .
1	It 's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it does n't offer any insights that have n't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the Dahmer heyday of the mid - '90s .
2	Wait for pay per view or rental but do n't dismiss BarberShop out of hand .
1	A few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and Jordan Brady 's direction is prosaic .
1	Each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top .
0	Would 've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film 's predictable denouement .
2	Then Nadia 's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all .
2	One of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily .
0	Nair just does n't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy .
3	Enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , Walt Becker 's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons .
4	It 's the funniest American comedy since Graffiti Bridge .
1	That neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks .
0	What starts off as a possible Argentine American Beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers .
0	The project 's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger Fatal Attraction into a high school setting .
1	In old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , Ms. Shreve 's novel proved too difficult a text to ` lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast .
1	Solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke
0	Stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little \*\*\*\* .
0	No cute factor here ... Not that I mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise .

2	A really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film .
0	Aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor Stephen Rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .

0	For its 100 minutes running time , you 'll wait in vain for a movie to happen .
0	A work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse .
3	A faster paced family flick .

1	While this film has an ` A ' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , Vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love .
0	It 's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .
1	Most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river .
2	It 's all gratuitous before long , as if Schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story .
2	`` I blame all men for war , '' -LRB- the warden 's daughter -RRB- tells her father .
1	The movie is about as deep as that sentiment .
2	It 's fitfully funny but never really takes off .
1	I 've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but Lil Bow Wow takes the cake .
3	By halfway through this picture I was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it ... Then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop .
2	For all the complications , it 's all surprisingly predictable .

1	For a film about action , Ultimate X is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype .
1	... a low rate Annie featuring some kid who ca n't act , only echoes of Jordan , and weirdo actor Crispin Glover screwing things up old school .
0	It might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the Saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness .
1	The picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male All About Eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the Intermezzo strain .
1	A nearly 21\/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent .
1	Gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid ... a curiously constricted epic .
2	It looks much more like a cartoon in the end than The Simpsons ever has .
1	With a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , Personal Velocity seems to be idling in neutral .
1	Does n't really add up to much .
1	It 's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there 's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind .

1	A prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp .
1	Borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion .
1	It 's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction .
0	A chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece ... so dull that its tagline should be : ` In space , no one can hear you snore . '
1	The characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience .
1	Sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor Hermocrates and Leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours .

1	Too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style .
1	There 's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age\/coming-out tale .
3	As much as I laughed throughout the movie , I can not mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys ' superhuman capacity to withstand pain .
1	The type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the -LRB- teen comedy -RRB- genre a bad name .
0	Distinctly sub-par ... more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine .
0	Plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of TV 's Dawson 's Creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of Love Story .
1	Unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you 're going to feel like you were n't invited to the party .
1	When the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read ` seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '

1	plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure Hollywood .
1	McTiernan 's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious .
1	High Crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government \/ Marine\/legal mystery , and that 's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue .

0	An exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound .
1	Not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans .
0	The movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it were n't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension .
1	Watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when Carol Kane appears on the screen .
1	The scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film 's characters .
2	Merchant has n't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage .
0	The film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it 's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is .
1	More a gunfest than a Rock concert .
0	It 's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt Miramax felt they owed to Benigni .
1	A muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations .
0	It makes me say the obvious : Abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here .
1	It 's not original enough .
0	A listless sci-fi comedy in which Eddie Murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect .
2	Little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its Summer X Games .
0	A generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it is n't merely offensive .
1	Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent .
0	An unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled ` hip ' , ` innovative ' and ` realistic ' .
0	The story 's pathetic and the gags are puerile . .
1	Curiously , Super Troopers suffers because it does n't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length .
0	So bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled Generic Jennifer Lopez Romantic Comedy .
2	I was sent a copyof this film to review on DVD .
2	For free .
0	I still want my money back .
1	It plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its `` dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework is even remotely new or interesting .
2	It 's hard to believe that a relationship like Holly and Marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive .
1	All too familiar ... basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when ` Angels With Dirty Faces ' appeared in 1938 .
2	... passable enough for a shoot-out in the o.k. court house of life type of flick .
2	Strictly middle of the road .
1	Although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it 's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s\/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .
1	After the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichÃ©s , depression and bad alternative music .
1	No one can doubt the filmmakers ' motives , but The Guys still feels counterproductive .
1	A very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel .
0	With little visible talent and no energy , Colin Hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee .
2	`` Feardotcom '' has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker .
2	A Meatballs for the bare-midriff generation .
2	Well-meaning to a fault , Antwone Fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man 's triumph of will into everyman 's romance comedy .
1	Seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product 's unshapely look , director Fisher Stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in Waking Life water colors .
1	Formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip .
1	Everything that was right about Blade is wrong in its sequel .
2	A few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot has n't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists ' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun .
1	The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Joel Schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one -LRB- and no one -RRB- .
1	Disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel .
0	Coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock .
0	Anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .
2	How much you are moved by the emotional tumult of -LRB- FranÃ§ois and MichÃ¨le 's -RRB- relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them .
1	They presume their audience wo n't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes .
0	Collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence .
0	The following things are not at all entertaining : The bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching Seinfeld -LRB- who is also one of the film 's producers -RRB- do everything he can to look like a good guy .
1	Attal 's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare I say , outdated , it 's a wonder that he could n't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident .
0	Obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque .
0	The most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters .
1	Michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it 's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously .
2	Ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies .
1	Enigma lacks it .
1	Potty-mouthed enough for PG-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as South Park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults .
2	... has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon does n't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites .
1	A distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour .
0	Most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement .
1	In the end , Tuck Everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in .
1	Rather less than the sum of its underventilated pÃ¨re-fils confrontations .
0	McKay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .
1	Plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line .
2	New Yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell ...
1	Amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way .
1	Yes , Spirited Away is a triumph of imagination , but it 's also a failure of storytelling .
1	A characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie .
2	A somewhat disappointing and meandering saga .
1	Whenever you think you 've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end .
2	But , no , we get another scene , and then another .
0	You begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain .
2	An empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility .
1	The screenplay , co-written by director Imogen Kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .
1	The milieu is wholly unconvincing ... and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch .
0	Unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters .
1	Each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .
2	Except for Paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for Bartleby 's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion .
2	Will no doubt delight Plympton 's legion of fans ; others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting .
1	The laughs are as rare as snake foo yung .
2	For a film that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , What to Do in Case of Fire ?
1	lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking .
1	Knockaround Guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be Quentin Tarantino when they grow up .
1	But they lack their idol 's energy and passion for detail .
1	Mattei so completely loses himself to the film 's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , Love in the Time of Money .
2	It briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - -- audience sadism -- is evaded completely .
3	Holland lets things peter out midway , but it 's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals .
1	For every articulate player , such as skateboarder Tony Hawk or BMX rider Mat Hoffman , are about a half dozen young Turks angling to see how many times they can work the words `` radical '' or `` suck '' into a sentence .
1	There 's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale .
1	An impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle .
1	It 's unfortunate that Wallace , who wrote Gibson 's Braveheart as well as the recent Pearl Harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue .
3	I liked the movie , but I know I would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further .
1	I 'm left slightly disappointed that it did n't .
1	Dreary tale of middle-class angst
1	For a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either .
1	-LRB- Jackson and Bledel -RRB- seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd .
2	Lillard and Cardellini earn their Scooby Snacks , but not anyone else .
1	Like Schindler 's List , The Grey Zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way .
0	An unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the DV revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .
2	-LRB- Screenwriter -RRB- Pimental took the Farrelly Brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation .
1	It 's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey .
1	Friday After Next is a lot more bluster than bite .
2	Its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up .
2	A decidedly mixed bag .
0	There are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels .
1	Ice Cube is n't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but Friday After Next spreads them pretty thin .
2	Not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending .
1	The characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality .
2	Everything else about High Crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented .
0	Just dreadful .
0	I do n't blame Eddie Murphy but should n't Owen Wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ?
1	Sweet Home Alabama certainly wo n't be remembered as one of -LRB- Witherspoon 's -RRB- better films .
1	hard as this may be to believe , Here on Earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film .
0	This is just lazy writing .
1	Even kids deserve better .
1	The pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie .
1	And Diesel is n't the actor to save it .
2	Bravo reveals the true intent of her film by carefully selecting interview subjects who will construct a portrait of Castro so predominantly charitable it can only be seen as propaganda .
2	... a preachy parable stylized with a touch of John Woo bullet ballet .
3	Frank Capra played this story straight .
0	But the 2002 film does n't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate ` comedy ' scenes .
2	How about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ?
0	The problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull .
4	Handled correctly , Wilde 's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice .
0	Here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked soufflÃ© .
0	`` Sorority Boys '' was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad .
1	A bizarre piece of work , with premise and dialogue at the level of kids ' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder
1	Paul Bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 .
2	It 's a gag that 's worn a bit thin over the years , though Do n't Ask still finds a few chuckles .
2	An uplifting drama ... What Antwone Fisher is n't , however , is original .
3	Often likable , but just as often it 's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy .
0	Certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , Eight Crazy Nights is a total misfire .
3	Elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side .
1	Showtime is n't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again .
1	All the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams .
0	This Tuxedo ... should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations .
2	I have no problem with `` difficult '' movies , or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out .
1	But first , you have to give the audience a reason to want to put for that effort
1	Been there , done that ... a thousand times already , and better .
0	What 's most offensive is n't the waste of a good cast , but the film 's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .
0	Sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness .
1	Fans of Plympton 's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers .
2	Barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality .
0	None of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of Sorority Boys is as appalling as any ` comedy ' to ever spill from a projector 's lens .
1	The kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics .
0	` Punch-Drunk Love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you 'd want to smash its face in . '
1	At once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance .
1	The trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of Showgirls .
1	While the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how Sand developed a notorious reputation .
0	A crass and insulting homage to great films like Some Like It Hot and the John Wayne classics .
2	What 's the most positive thing that can be said about the new Rob Schneider vehicle ?
2	Well , it 's not as pathetic as The Animal .
1	With all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen ... His Secret Life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles .
1	The problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up Shum 's good intentions .
1	What ` Blade Runner ' would 've looked like as a low-budget series on a UHF channel .
1	Has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , but because it has a bigger-name cast , it gets a full theatrical release .
1	With its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , All About the Benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s .
3	It never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time .
0	Loud , silly , stupid and pointless .
2	Mandel Holland 's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by Phifer and Black are ultimately winning .
0	You 'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie .
0	A yawn-provoking little farm melodrama .
1	Did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ?
1	Seriously , rent the Disney version .
0	As David Letterman and The Onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but Lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them .

1	A loquacious and dreary piece of business .
1	What the audience feels is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark -LRB- dark green , to be exact -RRB- , sour , bloody and mean .
0	director Hoffman , his writer and Kline 's agent should serve detention
2	Dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery .
3	Meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off Kahlo 's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant .
1	Time of Favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation .
0	I 'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on Johnny Knoxville 's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche .
2	While Serving Sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest Austin Powers extravaganza , there 's nothing here to match that movie 's intermittent moments of inspiration .
0	I 'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by Vincent R. Nebrida or the gutless direction by Laurice Guillen .
1	The only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow .
2	Whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors .
1	As with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else .
0	The Irwins ' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts .
1	If routine action and jokes like this are your cup of tea , then pay your $ 8 and get ready for the big shear .
0	This is one baaaaaaaaad movie .
4	A man leaving the screening said the film was better than Saving Private Ryan .
2	He may have meant the Internet short Saving Ryan 's Privates .

1	May puzzle his most ardent fans .
1	Starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill .
1	We never feel anything for these characters , and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity .
2	Those unfamiliar with Mormon traditions may find The Singles Ward occasionally bewildering .
2	Ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head , but he knows how to pose Madonna .
2	The story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long .
1	Feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form .
1	While you have to admit it 's semi-amusing to watch Robert DeNiro belt out `` When you 're a Jet , you 're a Jet all the way , '' it 's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to `` Tonight . ''
0	The whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it 's trying to set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years . '
1	... the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well ... but quite frankly , Scoob and Shag do n't eat enough during the film . '
0	More of the same old garbage Hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now .
1	TV skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen .
1	-LRB- Johnnie To and Wai Ka Fai are -RRB- sure to find an enthusiastic audience among American action-adventure buffs , but the film 's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers .

0	It 's as sorry a mess as its director 's diabolical debut , Mad Cows .
1	Any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director Jon Purdy 's sledgehammer sap .
1	Its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , Steven Soderbergh 's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience .
1	Despite some strong performances , never rises above the level of a telanovela .
2	This is a picture that Maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool .

0	Unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications .

3	Welles groupie\/scholar Peter Bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he 's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant William Randolph Hearst .
1	Makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place .
0	Even as I valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , I could feel my eyelids ... getting ... very ... heavy ...
0	A bad movie that happened to good actors .
1	Boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome .

1	If you saw Benigni 's Pinocchio at a public park , you 'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police .
2	The animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but Jonah ... never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment .
2	The pace of the film is very slow -LRB- for obvious reasons -RRB- and that too becomes off-putting .
1	Mr. Wollter and Ms. Seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear .
1	Shafer 's feature does n't offer much in terms of plot or acting .

1	What happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ?
1	Despite some comic sparks , Welcome to Collinwood never catches fire .
1	Director George Hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place .
1	Shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling .
1	Even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency .
3	Some Body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves .
1	All the small moments and flashbacks do n't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition .
1	-LRB- A -RRB- stale retread of the '53 original .
1	One thing 's for sure -- if George Romero had directed this movie , it would n't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head .
0	For dance completists only .
0	Spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations

1	The locale ... remains far more interesting than the story at hand .
2	Yo , it 's The Days Of Our Lives meets Electric Boogaloo .
0	I liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it 's too long and it goes nowhere .
0	This little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it ca n't really be called animation .
0	Makes 98 minutes feel like three hours .
1	Hawke 's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , does n't tell you anything except that the Chelsea Hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes .
1	Aspires to the cracked lunacy of The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like The Adventures of Ford Fairlane .

0	The title , alone , should scare any sane person away .
1	Low comedy does n't come much lower .
1	Appropriately cynical social commentary aside , # 9 never quite ignites .

1	One of the most depressing movie-going experiences I can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called ` comedy ' and not laugh once .
1	This is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream .
2	Let 's face it -- there are n't many reasons anyone would want to see Crossroads if they 're not big fans of teen pop kitten Britney Spears .
0	A loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy .
1	An exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as Katzenberg 's The Prince of Egypt from 1998 .
0	The movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory .
1	The movie 's vision of a white American zealously spreading a Puritanical brand of Christianity to South Seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish .

1	The great pity is that those responsible did n't cut their losses -- and ours -- and retitle it The Adventures of Direct-to-Video Nash , and send it to its proper home .
2	About as original as a gangster sweating bullets while worrying about a contract on his life .
1	An empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal .
2	We could have expected a little more human being , and a little less product .
1	Instead of using George and Lucy 's most obvious differences to ignite sparks , Lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on George 's haplessness and Lucy 's personality tics .
2	Whether Quitting will prove absorbing to American audiences is debatable .
0	Becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that does n't and a thriller that wo n't .
1	Family togetherness takes a back seat to inter-family rivalry and workplace ambition ... whole subplots have no explanation or even plot relevance .
1	Grant is n't Cary and Bullock is n't Katherine .
1	Like a fish that 's lived too long , Austin Powers in Goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places .
3	Two tedious acts light on great scares and a good surprise ending .
1	Shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom .
0	The entire movie is in need of a scented bath .
1	I 'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - Arnold is not , nor will he be , back .
0	The story of Trouble Every Day ... is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie 's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult .
1	A Movie to Forget
0	For all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2Â 1\/2 - hour running time .

1	The film 's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that Tornatore was right to cut .
1	The movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating .
0	I found it slow , predictable and not very amusing .
1	Director Yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we have n't seen 10,000 times .
0	Viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who 's who in this pretentious mess .
2	A pint-sized ` Goodfellas ' designed to appeal to the younger set , it 's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one 's interest .
0	Get out your pooper-scoopers .
3	While the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think .

2	-- was a fad that had long since vanished .
1	It 's a long way from Orwell 's dark , intelligent warning cry -LRB- 1984 -RRB- to the empty stud knockabout of Equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation .

1	Starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera .
3	While there 's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the Elizabethans -LRB- as well as rank frustration from those in the know about Rubbo 's dumbed-down tactics -RRB- , Much Ado About Something is an amicable endeavor .

2	Most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for Shearer 's radio show and his Simpson voice-overs .
1	Perry 's good and his is an interesting character , but `` Serving Sara '' has n't much more to serve than silly fluff .
2	Nor is it a romantic comedy .
2	Culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-Harry Potter -- right down to the Gryffindor scarf .
1	Memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual .
2	It 's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good .
1	In the not-too-distant future , movies like Ghost Ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds .
1	Right now , they 're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination .

1	Unlike Trey Parker , Sandler does n't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself .
1	A fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them .
0	An empty , purposeless exercise .
2	Earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock .
0	Haneke 's script -LRB- from Elfriede Jelinek 's novel -RRB- is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending .

2	Ultimately , Jane learns her place as a girl , softens up and loses some of the intensity that made her an interesting character to begin with .
1	Ah-nuld 's action hero days might be over .
1	It 's clear why Deuces Wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on MGM 's shelf .
2	Feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker 's attempt to surround himself with beautiful , half-naked women .
2	When the precise nature of Matthew 's predicament finally comes into sharp focus , the revelation fails to justify the build-up .

1	The feature-length stretch ... strains the show 's concept .
1	This slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time .
2	A film that will probably please people already fascinated by Behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration .
2	Davis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that does n't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine .
1	The densest distillation of Roberts ' movies ever made .
1	Ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy clichÃ© of the ugly American abroad , and the too-frosty exterior Ms. Paltrow employs to authenticate her British persona is another liability .
1	A handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on PBS than a night out at an AMC .
2	Tom Green and an Ivy League college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like Stealing Harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 .
2	-LRB- It -RRB- highlights not so much the crime lord 's messianic bent , but Spacey 's .
0	Master of Disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours .

2	The niftiest trick perpetrated by The Importance of Being Earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of Wilde into Austen -- and a Hollywood-ized Austen at that .
0	Tykwer 's surface flash is n't just a poor fit with Kieslowski 's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything Kieslowski 's work aspired to , including the condition of art .
2	Ice Age is the first computer-generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies , and that makes for some glacial pacing early on .
1	Too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility .

0	No French people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half .
3	Though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should .
1	`` One look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid ? ''
1	Um ... is n't that the basis for the entire plot ?
2	`` Not really as bad as you might think ! ''
2	Strident and inelegant in its ` message-movie ' posturing .
4	One regards Reign of Fire with awe .
2	What a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea .
2	It has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material .
1	Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy .
3	Seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director 's experiment is a successful one .
2	The plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish .
1	I suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the DVD .
0	An unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it .
2	Ninety minutes of Viva Castro !
1	can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of Jesse Helms ' anti- Castro rhetoric , which are included
0	Comes off as a long , laborious whine , the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man .
1	It just goes to show , an intelligent person is n't necessarily an admirable storyteller .
2	In a 102-minute film , Aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time .
1	... most viewers will wish there had been more of the `` Queen '' and less of the `` Damned . ''
0	Hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired .
1	Kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for -LRB- or worth rooting against , for that matter -RRB- .
1	It reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it .
2	None of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of Bond , but much of it is good for a laugh .
1	The problem with `` XXX '' is that its own action is n't very effective .
1	A great script brought down by lousy direction .
2	Same guy with both hats .
1	Big mistake .
1	A mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it 's the butt of its own joke .
2	Director Kevin Bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the `` Miami Vice '' checklist of power boats , Latin music and dog tracks .
1	He does n't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show 's trademark style and flash .
2	In gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz .
2	The Spalding Gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy .
1	Perhaps even the SLC high command found writer-director Mitch Davis 's wall of kitsch hard going .
3	According to Wendigo , ` nature ' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves .
3	An encouraging effort from McCrudden
1	The romance between the leads is n't as compelling or as believable as it should be .
0	If I could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , I would go back and choose to skip it .
2	Fortunately , you still have that option .
1	Supposedly authentic account of a historical event that 's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment .
1	Adroit but finally a trifle flat , Mad Love does n't galvanize its outrage the way , say , Jane Campion might have done , but at least it possesses some .
1	To Blandly Go Where We Went 8 Movies Ago ...
1	A slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally .
1	This u-boat does n't have a captain .
1	With nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , -LRB- Crane -RRB- becomes more specimen than character -- and Auto Focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report .
0	This one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit .
0	Dull , a road-trip movie that 's surprisingly short of both adventure and song .
1	I walked away not really know who `` they '' were , what `` they '' looked like .
1	Why `` they '' were here and what `` they '' wanted and quite honestly , I did n't care .
0	After several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you 'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of Jerry Bruckheimer productions , especially because Half Past Dead is like The Rock on a Wal-Mart budget .
2	A relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd , contrived , overblown , and entirely implausible finale .
0	The Country Bears wastes an exceptionally good idea .
0	But the movie that does n't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences
2	Adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like Pinocchio .
1	As for children , they wo n't enjoy the movie at all .
0	... you can be forgiven for realizing that you 've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for Frida to just die already .
1	Too bad writer-director Adam Rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the Golden Eagle 's carpets .
2	It 's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another .
1	The movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you .
2	The movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as Jules Verne 's ' 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ' and the George Pal version of H.G. Wells ' ` The Time Machine . '
1	But its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .
1	Despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings .
1	even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other Bullock and Grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene .
1	What should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test .
1	A bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for Universal Studios and its ancillary products . . .
1	little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic .
2	The movie strains to stay on the light , comic side of the issue , despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and , potentially , of life itself .
0	The Master of Disguise is awful .
0	It 's Pauly Shore awful .
1	Do n't say you were n't warned .
1	Disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies ... or any other John Woo flick for that matter .
2	The entire movie is filled with deja vu moments .
1	` Opening up ' the play more has partly closed it down .
3	What -LRB- Frei -RRB- gives us ... is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows .
1	An ugly , revolting movie .
1	The film is way too full of itself ; it 's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-Oscar kind of way .
0	The movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing I can say is that I ca n't remember a single name responsible for it .
1	Watching `` Ending '' is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor 's garage sale .
0	You ca n't believe anyone would really buy this stuff .
2	Certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic .
0	It desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time .
1	The skills of a calculus major at M.I.T. are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long-winded heist comedy Who Is Cletis Tout ?
0	From the choppy editing to the annoying score to ` special effects ' by way of replacing objects in a character 's hands below the camera line , `` Besotted '' is misbegotten
1	My advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack .
2	A film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations .
1	Filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life .
2	directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name
2	The 70-year-old Godard has become , to judge from In Praise of Love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them .
1	An unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously .
1	Solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous .
2	Harvard Man is a semi-throwback , a reminiscence without nostalgia or sentimentality .
2	Supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy .
0	Alas , getting there is not even half the interest .
2	While Hoffman 's performance is great , the subject matter goes nowhere .
2	The smash 'em - up , crash 'em - up , shoot 'em - up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense .
1	Deuces Wild treads heavily into Romeo and Juliet\/West Side Story territory , where it plainly has no business going .
1	Hart 's War seems to want to be a character study , but apparently ca n't quite decide which character .
1	Theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues .
1	This latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made B movie is long gone .
1	Novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama .
1	Been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called The Professional .
0	The film is all over the place , really .
1	It dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum .
2	The beautiful , unusual music is this film 's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep .
1	The action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory .
0	Forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining .
1	When -LRB- Reno -RRB- lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at George W. Bush , Henry Kissinger , Larry King , et al. , Reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture .
1	Such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but Kaufman and Gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go .
0	Burns ' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off .
1	While this one gets off with a good natured warning , future Lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
0	Another boorish movie from the I-heard-a-joke - at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting .
1	Too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story would n't work without all those gimmicks .
0	It 's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie .
0	And it 's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it .
1	The ethos of the Chelsea Hotel may shape Hawke 's artistic aspirations , but he has n't yet coordinated his own DV poetry with the Beat he hears in his soul .
2	The sight of the name Bruce Willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind -- maybe too much .
0	Why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ?
0	The obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old Hanna-Barbera charm .
2	Exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as Kerrigan 's platinum-blonde hair .
1	The movie 's downfall is to substitute plot for personality .
1	It does n't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .
1	All mood and no movie .
0	Press the delete key .
3	Simone is not a bad film .
1	It just does n't have anything really interesting to say .
1	Once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional .
2	... hopefully it 'll be at the dollar theatres by the time Christmas rolls around .
1	Wait to see it then .
0	There 's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer .
2	Or for the year , for that matter .
0	Lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck .
0	This hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on Hopkins ' inclination to play Hannibal Lecter again , even though Harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book .
1	Death to Smoochy tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly - as-nasty - as-it - thinks-it-is joke .
1	Over and over again .
0	The threat implied in the title PokÃ©mon 4ever is terrifying -- like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming .
1	The film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class .
0	To call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it .
2	Entertainment more disposable than Hanna-Barbera 's half-hour cartoons ever were .
1	The film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original New Testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries .
3	By the end of it all I sort of loved the people onscreen , even though I could not stand them .
2	Perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter .
1	It 's not an easy one to review .
1	At best this is a film for the under-7 crowd .
1	But it would be better to wait for the video .
2	And a very rainy day .
1	The whole talking-animal thing is grisly .
3	Never Again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction .
2	Would n't it be funny if a bunch of Allied soldiers went undercover as women in a German factory during World War II ?
2	Um , no. .
1	But here 's a movie about it anyway .
2	Has not so much been written as assembled , Frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups .
1	The punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one .
2	But Death to Smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end .
2	Mushes the college-friends genre -LRB- The Big Chill -RRB- together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas .
2	Showtime 's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment .
3	Those who trek to the ` plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves .
0	But ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as Mr. De Niro .
1	A determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really does n't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird .
3	Too daft by half ... but supremely good natured .
0	Fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation ... Well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care .
0	It 's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes ... finally seem so impersonal or even shallow .
1	Woody , what happened ?
3	Juliette Binoche 's Sand is vivacious , but it 's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile .
0	It 's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on Oprah .
1	You can tell almost immediately that Welcome to Collinwood is n't going to jell .
1	Throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : So why is this so boring ?
1	Cattaneo reworks the formula that made The Full Monty a smashing success ... but neglects to add the magic that made it all work .
2	Routine and rather silly .
0	A rip-off twice removed , modeled after -LRB- Seagal 's -RRB- earlier copycat Under Siege , sometimes referred to as Die Hard on a boat .
0	Totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are The Greatest Musicians of All Time .
0	You can practically hear George Orwell turning over .
1	Behan 's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best Irish sense -- but Sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance .
2	While Holm is terrific as both men and Hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise .
0	Lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it 's compelling .
0	If it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in Dolby Digital stereo .
1	If nothing else , `` Rollerball '' 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by LL Cool J.
2	A movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire .
1	How do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ?
1	On the evidence before us , the answer is clear : Not easily and , in the end , not well enough .
0	The film 's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what I was expecting .
1	More trifle than triumph .
0	The movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction .
0	Festers in just such a dungpile that you 'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .
1	Lyne 's latest , the erotic thriller Unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded .
1	It sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that 's more or less how it plays out .
1	Rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic .
1	Report card : Does n't live up to the exalted tagline - there 's definite room for improvement .
0	Does n't deserve a passing grade -LRB- even on a curve -RRB- .
0	The pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and Naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated .
2	As his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in Long Time Dead says ` I 'm telling you , this is f \*\*\* ed ' .
3	Maybe he was reading the minds of the audience .
1	... if it had been only half-an-hour long or a TV special , the humor would have been fast and furious -- at ninety minutes , it drags .
1	Bean drops the ball too many times ... hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay .
2	A well-acted , but one-note film .
1	Blood Work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from Eastwood 's Dirty Harry period .
1	The movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications .
0	-LRB- Lee -RRB- treats his audience the same way that Jim Brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects .
3	And Lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception .
0	There 's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue .
0	No amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script .
1	It 's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise .
1	Nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here .
2	The Armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment .
1	Earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner .
1	Ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of Louis Begley 's source novel -LRB- About Schmidt -RRB- and an old Payne screenplay .
3	The exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors .
0	We started to wonder if ... some unpaid intern had just typed ` Chris Rock , ' ` Anthony Hopkins ' and ` terrorists ' into some Univac-like script machine .
1	Even when Crush departs from the 4W formula ... it feels like a glossy rehash .
1	More likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat .
0	Bears is even worse than I imagined a movie ever could be .
0	When you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble .
1	This is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives .
0	Marinated in clichÃ©s and mawkish dialogue .
1	Whether it 's the worst movie of 2002 , I ca n't say for sure : Memories of Rollerball have faded , and I skipped Country Bears .
0	But this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title .
1	-LRB- A -RRB- boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain .
1	Not once in the rush to save the day did I become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of ` eh . '
0	Rollerball IS as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine .
1	The first question to ask about Bad Company is why Anthony Hopkins is in it .
0	We assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low .
1	Not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general .
1	It merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .
1	Shame on writer\/director Vicente Aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull .
2	Suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling .
1	Violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining .
1	Nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters .
0	With a completely predictable plot , you 'll swear that you 've seen it all before , even if you 've never come within a mile of The Longest Yard .
1	Remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ?
2	When the twist endings were actually surprising ?
2	When the violence actually shocked ?
2	When the heroes were actually under 40 ?
1	Sadly , as Blood Work proves , that was a long , long time ago .
1	Blue Crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky `` Pretty Woman '' retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought .
0	This movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in Retard 101 .
0	What we get in FearDotCom is more like something from a bad Clive Barker movie .
0	In other words , it 's badder than bad .
1	If they broke out into elaborate choreography , singing and finger snapping it might have held my attention , but as it stands I kept looking for the last exit from Brooklyn .
1	A sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like The Ghost and Mr. Chicken .
1	A small independent film suffering from a severe case of Hollywood-itis .
1	Where the film falters is in its tone .
1	The story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head .
1	Ultimately , Sarah 's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness .
2	It 's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up .
0	Feels more like a rejected X-Files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening .
2	Some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills .
0	Men in Black II achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as Whiffle-Ball epic .
2	An enigmatic film that 's too clever for its own good , it 's a conundrum not worth solving .
0	A zombie movie in every sense of the word -- mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious .
2	A film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted .
0	It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a Mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that .
3	Definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the Roman Colosseum .
1	Certainly not a good movie , but it was n't horrible either .
1	Although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful .
1	The result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel .
0	It appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clichÃ©s the filmmakers could dredge up .
1	Nothing but an episode of Smackdown !
2	in period costume and with a bigger budget .
3	It takes you somewhere you 're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface -LRB- and exotic dancing -RRB- it 's surprisingly old-fashioned .
0	While the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible Anne Rice novel it 's based upon , Queen Of The Damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .
1	It should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring .
2	A good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance .
0	A tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid .
0	If Hill is n't quite his generation 's Don Siegel -LRB- or Robert Aldrich -RRB- , it 's because there 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it 's all bluster and clichÃ© .
0	Stealing Harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : A few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious .
1	This is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors .
2	Does anyone much think the central story of Brendan Behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ?
0	` Martin Lawrence Live ' is so self-pitying , I almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show .
1	The dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so .
1	Never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three .
1	It has become apparent that the franchise 's best years are long past .
2	Does what should seem impossible : it makes serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer boring .
2	Do n't hate El Crimen del Padre Amaro because it 's anti-Catholic .
0	Hate it because it 's lousy .
1	... better described as a ghost story gone badly awry .
0	Like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they 're struggling to create .
1	The filmmakers are playing to the Big Boys in New York and L.A. To that end , they mock the kind of folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either .
3	Competently directed but terminally cute drama .
1	The big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing .
1	Not just unlikable .
1	Disturbing .
0	Disgusting .
0	Without any redeeming value whatsoever .
0	This thing is virtually unwatchable .
3	Those eternally devoted to the insanity of Black will have an intermittently good time .
0	Feel free to go get popcorn whenever he 's not onscreen .
1	The self-serious Equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , is n't much fun without the highs and lows .
3	The work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who ca n't get out of his own way .
0	The main characters are simply named The Husband , The Wife and The Kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .
0	In terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused .
0	Swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then .
1	The only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies .
0	The characters ... are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script .
2	A Sha-Na-Na sketch punctuated with graphic violence .
1	The trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through .
2	Spy-vs .
0	- spy action flick with Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu never comes together .
0	A so-so , made-for-TV something posing as a real movie .
2	The only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its Labor Day weekend upload , FearDotCom should log a minimal number of hits .
1	Whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it 's an unhappy situation all around .
1	An uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection .
3	A formula family tearjerker told with a heavy Irish brogue ... accentuating , rather than muting , the plot 's saccharine thrust .
1	This is Sandler running on empty , repeating what he 's already done way too often .
1	This is as lax and limp a comedy as I 've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material .
0	Time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool `` Clockstoppers , '' but that does n't mean it still wo n't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life .
1	The sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset .
2	Aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production does n't work for me .
2	A preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in Brooklyn circa 1958 .
1	Has none of the crackle of `` Fatal Attraction '' , `` 9 1\/2 Weeks '' , or even `` Indecent Proposal '' , and feels more like Lyne 's stolid remake of `` Lolita '' .
2	Everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the Tinseltown assembly line .
2	An extraordinarily silly thriller .
1	A rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade .
0	Gaping plot holes sink this ` sub ' - standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth .
1	Talkiness is n't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark .
1	The beautiful images and solemn words can not disguise the slack complacency of -LRB- Godard 's -RRB- vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice .
3	The stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny .
1	The movie is n't painfully bad , something to be ` fully experienced ' ; it 's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten .
1	Charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past Love Story derisions .
0	What a great shame that such a talented director as Chen Kaige has chosen to make his English-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted .
0	No amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story .
3	The film ... presents classic moral-condundrum drama : What would you have done to survive ?
1	The problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of Auschwitz II-Birkenau .
1	... for all its social and political potential , State Property does n't end up being very inspiring or insightful .
1	A film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this is n't .
1	Little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point ... is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .
0	The nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations .
1	This is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy .
2	This off-putting French romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of AmÃ©lie .
1	overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
2	Ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy .
2	If there ai n't none , you have a problem .
1	The Master of Disguise falls under the category of ` should have been a sketch on Saturday Night Live . '
2	Yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a ca n't - miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong .
0	Koepp 's screenplay is n't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own .
1	Is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ?
1	More successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine
0	Clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades .
1	It 's hard to pity the ` plain ' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss .
0	Rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash .
0	A banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy .
1	The drama discloses almost nothing .
1	A minor-league soccer remake of The Longest Yard .
1	Belongs in the too-hot-for-TV direct-to-video\/DVD category , and this is why I have given it a one-star rating .
1	As earnest as a community-college advertisement , American Chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school .
0	A dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the Animal Planet documentary series , Crocodile Hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring .
2	There is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down .
2	And that should tell you everything you need to know about All the Queen 's Men .
1	Even fans of Ismail Merchant 's work , I suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one .
2	It 's really just another silly Hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows .
2	It 's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one .
4	The world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like Martin Scorsese .
2	But it does n't need Gangs of New York .
2	Enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts ... What is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with Cage 's best acting .
2	Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate .
2	It 's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you 'll likely think of this one .
0	Sade achieves the near-impossible : It turns the Marquis de Sade into a dullard .
1	-LRB- Lin Chung 's -RRB- voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating -LRB- at least to this Western ear -RRB- , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters .
1	One of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies I 've ever seen .
1	Though there 's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film 's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish .
0	Unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .
1	Unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction , Impostor is opening today at a theater near you .
0	It should be doing a lot of things , but does n't .
1	Chen films the resolutely downbeat Smokers Only with every indulgent , indie trick in the book .
1	... a rather bland affair .
2	Far-fetched premise , convoluted plot , and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love .
2	The movie tries to be ethereal , but ends up seeming goofy .
2	I was hoping that it would be sleazy and fun , but it was neither .
2	Harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden .
0	Soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , XXX achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence .
1	A boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even Kingsley , are made to look bad .
0	All the Queen 's Men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers .
1	The filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart .
1	Rather than real figures , Elling and Kjell Bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naÃ¯f 's encounter with the world .
3	Mariah Carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in Glitter here in Wisegirls .
1	It 's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it 's all about the silences and if you 're into that , have at it .
1	I suspect that you 'll be as bored watching Morvern Callar as the characters are in it .
0	If you go , pack your knitting needles .
0	The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma .
1	We do n't even like their characters .
0	Some writer dude , I think his name was , uh , Michael Zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that I ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck .
1	The movie does n't generate a lot of energy .
0	It is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously .
1	This feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
1	Spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning .
1	It feels like very light Errol Morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs .
0	A period story about a Catholic boy who tries to help a Jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell .
0	The premise itself is just SOOOOO tired .
0	Pair that with really poor comedic writing ... and you 've got a huge mess .
1	Proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness .
1	Did we really need a remake of `` Charade ? ''
2	Some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff .
1	Stealing Harvard ca n't even do that much .
0	Each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth .
1	The only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game .
1	You try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored .
1	I spied with my little eye ... a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits
1	Entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching Disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel .
1	The satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying .
0	Less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is .
2	an `` O Bruin , Where Art Thou ? ''
3	- style cross-country adventure ... it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack .
1	A feeble Tootsie knockoff .
0	An awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers .
0	... the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid .
0	The very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary .
1	An allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals African American professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message .
2	A very familiar tale , one that 's been told by countless filmmakers about Italian - , Chinese - , Irish - , Latin - , Indian - , Russian - and other hyphenate American young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages .
1	One key problem with these ardently Christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out .
2	Essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality
1	A relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty World War II action flick .
0	-LRB- Hell is -RRB- looking down at your watch and realizing Serving Sara is n't even halfway through .
1	Too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community .
1	Leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances .
2	... a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable .
0	Swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress Andie MacDowell .
1	The histrionic muse still eludes Madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch .
0	You have no affinity for most of the characters .
1	Nothing about them is attractive .
1	What they see in each other also is difficult to fathom .
3	Diaz , Applegate , Blair and Posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused .
2	A technically well-made suspenser ... but its abrupt drop in IQ points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide .
0	An inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .
1	It 's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition .
2	Absolutely -LRB- and unintentionally -RRB- terrifying .
2	Eckstraordinarily lame and Severely boring .
1	Eight Legged Freaks falls flat as a spoof .
1	No matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a Michael Jackson sort of way .
0	You 'll just have your head in your hands wondering why Lee 's character did n't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery .
1	` Dragonfly ' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue .
2	In his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , Silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls .
2	Blade II has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation .
2	Veers uncomfortably close to pro-Serb propaganda .
0	Movies like High Crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation .
0	How about surprising us by trying something new ?
0	Final verdict : You 've seen it all before .
1	Throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , Windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old World War II movie for overly familiar material .
2	If A Few Good Men told us that we `` ca n't handle the truth '' than High Crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we `` do n't care about the truth . ''
0	Further sad evidence that Tom Tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning Run Lola Run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap .
0	You 'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the Zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy .
2	The movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course .
2	This will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things .
0	A full-frontal attack on audience patience .
2	Any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of God are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that Bean abhors .
1	It 's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled .
1	Debut effort by `` Project Greenlight '' winner is sappy and amateurish .
2	One gets the impression the creators of Do n't Ask Do n't Tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes .
0	Too bad none of it is funny .
2	The cast has a high time , but de Broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp .
1	The film , like Jimmy 's routines , could use a few good laughs .
2	The film has too many spots where it 's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that 's especially fit for the kiddies .
1	Purports to be a Hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging .
3	Oh , and more entertaining , too .
0	... in the pile of useless actioners from MTV schmucks who do n't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .
2	Though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal , I felt disrespected .
1	Humor in I Spy is so anemic .
1	The film is strictly routine .
2	Skillful as he is , Mr. Shyamalan is undone by his pretensions .
2	While the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched Stephen Norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning David S. Goyer is much sillier .
0	In addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase .
2	It shares the first two films ' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between .
2	The Santa Clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but I 've got to give it thumbs down .
0	You can not guess why the cast and crew did n't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed .
1	Barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull .
2	If you 're really renting this you 're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you 're interested in Anne Geddes , John Grisham , and Thomas Kincaid .
1	We get the comedy we settle for .
1	The uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them .
2	Two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning .
0	A word of advice to the makers of The Singles Ward : Celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs .
1	And neither do cliches , no matter how ` inside ' they are .
3	The campy results make Mel Brooks ' Borscht Belt schtick look sophisticated .
1	Its appeal will probably limited to LDS Church members and undemanding armchair tourists .
1	The Hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork .
1	Cherish would 've worked a lot better had it been a short film .
0	Manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney ... take your pick .
1	All three descriptions suit Evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new .
2	Hey Arnold !
2	is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation .
3	Still , the updated Dickensian sensibility of writer Craig Bartlett 's story is appealing .
1	True to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at .
0	Does n't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the Sundance Film Festival two years ago .
0	The plot is paper-thin and the characters are n't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours .
1	Kaufman 's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious .
2	The film did n't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due .
1	Queen of the Damned is too long with too little going on .
1	It collapses when Mr. Taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller 's rush .
1	Any film that does n't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .
0	... Blade II is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves .
1	The Rules of Attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing .
1	Though there are many tense scenes in Trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful .
2	In this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian .
0	Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .
2	You have once again entered the bizarre realm where director Adrian Lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal .
1	The high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : There 's very little hustling on view .
1	This director 's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera .
0	Characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .
2	the Venezuelans say things like `` si , pretty much '' and `` por favor , go home '' when talking to Americans .
1	That 's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of `` Dragonfly . ''
1	It 's a movie that ends with Truckzilla , for cryin ' out loud .
0	If that does n't clue you in that something 's horribly wrong , nothing will .
1	Director Tom Shadyac and star Kevin Costner glumly mishandle the story 's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself .
0	It 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 .
0	Like the Tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
0	As pedestrian as they come .
1	A film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen .
0	It 's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary .
2	Put it somewhere between Sling Blade and South of Heaven , West of Hell in the pantheon of Billy Bob 's body of work .
1	More intellectually scary than dramatically involving .
1	An inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle .
1	The abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture ca n't quite conceal that there 's nothing resembling a spine here .
1	As saccharine as it is disposable .
1	You come away thinking not only that Kate is n't very bright , but that she has n't been worth caring about and that maybe she , Janine and Molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another .
1	The metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery .
0	Very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .
1	Too much power , not enough puff .
0	The attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show .
1	It 's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by Taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion that Hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances .
0	A cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic Ladies and Gentlemen , The Fabulous Stains ... Crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential .
2	Muddled , trashy and incompetent
1	For this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull Sorvino has no light touch , and Rodan is out of his league .
1	Narc is all menace and atmosphere .
2	Though excessively tiresome , The Uncertainty Principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore .
1	Despite Juliet Stevenon 's attempt to bring cohesion to Pamela 's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs .
0	It 's tough to be startled when you 're almost dozing .
1	his -LRB- Nelson 's -RRB- screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it .
1	It 's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead .
0	A terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving .
0	There are many definitions of ` time waster ' but this movie must surely be one of them .
1	As it stands , Crocodile Hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 Godzilla , which combined scenes of a Japanese monster flick with canned shots of Raymond Burr commenting on the monster 's path of destruction .
2	The thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie .
1	Enigma is well-made , but it 's just too dry and too placid .
3	`` Sweet Home Alabama '' is what it is -- a nice , harmless date film ...
4	One of the best , most understated performances of -LRB- Jack Nicholson 's -RRB- career .
3	The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys ' take on adolescence feels painfully true .
4	It 's a masterpiece .
2	It may not be `` Last Tango in Paris '' but ...
1	They crush each other under cars , throw each other out windows , electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness .
3	And we do n't avert our eyes for a moment .
2	Charming and funny -LRB- but ultimately silly -RRB- movie .
4	Third time 's the charm ... yeah , baby !
2	A pleasant , if forgettable , romp of a film .
3	By the end of the movie , you 're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular .
3	Birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters .
3	` Stock up on silver bullets for director Neil Marshall 's intense freight train of a film . '
3	The film delivers what it promises : A look at the `` wild ride '' that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans .
3	As a film director , LaBute continues to improve .
4	Will warm your heart without making you feel guilty about it .
3	Catch it ... if you can !
2	Worse than ` Silence of the Lambs ' better than ` Hannibal '
1	American and European cinema has amassed a vast Holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than The Grey Zone .
3	` Possession , ' based on the book by A.S. Byatt , demands that LaBute deal with the subject of love head-on ; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit
4	It 's the kind of movie that , aside from Robert Altman , Spike Lee , the Coen Brothers and a few others , our moviemakers do n't make often enough .
3	Alternates between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking loneliness and is n't afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience .
3	The script is smart , not cloying .
3	Visually , ` Santa Clause 2 ' is wondrously creative .
4	A bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker 's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing .
4	One fantastic -LRB- and educational -RRB- documentary .
3	An ambitious ` what if ? '
3	that works .
3	`` The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys '' has flaws , but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors
3	Nice piece of work .
3	` Stock up on silver bullets for director Neil Marshall 's intense freight train of a film . '
3	It 's funny , as the old saying goes , because it 's true .
3	Though the film is static , its writer-director 's heart is in the right place , his plea for democracy and civic action laudable .
2	The filmmaker 's heart is in the right place ...
3	From blushing to gushing -- Imamura squirts the screen in ` Warm Water Under a Red Bridge '
4	Apart from anything else , this is one of the best-sustained ideas I have ever seen on the screen .
3	Not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral -- and , hence , more chillingly effective .
0	Stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish .
2	Yep , it 's `` Waking up in Reno . ''
1	Go back to sleep .

1	A prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell .
2	The movie is obviously a labour of love so Howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted .
1	This is n't a movie ; it 's a symptom .
0	What we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance .
